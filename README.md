## Inspiration
 Due to many technologies and introduction of overly complicated focus timers & music player, I was left overwhelmed.
 
 

## What it does
I then decided to make a minimal & non-overwhelming tool which aids people suffering from ADHD & anxiety to focus & concentrate using a pomodoro timer integrated with lofi music player.

This has a very minimal interface as well as aesthetic look to it.

Everyone is welcome to my little happy place! :) 




## How we built it
 The website was built with HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. Along with these, the website was deployed using Github-pages & a custom domain was used.
 Each photo was generated by DALL-E - AI image generator.

## Challenges we ran into
 The biggest challenge we ran into was the time frame, we had to build the website in 24 hours. We also had to learn how to use Github-pages & how to deploy a website using it.
 
 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 The User-Interface of the website is really minimal and non-spammy.
 Perfect for people suffering from ADHD & anxiety. 
 
 

## What we learned
 * How to use Github-pages
 * DALL-E was fun, the logo was generated by an AI :) 
 * sharpened our skills in HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.


## What's next for Business Ship
 * Introducing a chatbot to connect with other people
 * Nothing else, it is perfect as it is :)
